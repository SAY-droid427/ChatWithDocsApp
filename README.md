# ChatWithDocsApp
This is a real-time chat application built using vanilla JavaScript , socket.io, moment.js, Express and Node.This app has been built as a part of the DevFest hackathon in which we have built a dashboard for the problem statement 'Improve the LockDown Experience'.

During the lockdown people have faced major health related problems other than the fear of the Covid-19 virus also.

The real time chat application has been built to help people with medical assistance from the comforts and safety of their homes. In this unprecedented Covid-19, people are often afraid to step outside their homes to reach out to doctors and consult them for minor ailments. also, the hospitals and health centers are getting converted into Covid hospitals. So, in order to help people communicate with the frontline warriors, 'Chat With Docs' enables a user to join the room i.e the required medical assistance type like general physician, paediatrician, etc and consult with the doctors.

The app has been deployed at :https://arcane-sierra-51644.herokuapp.com/index.html .
